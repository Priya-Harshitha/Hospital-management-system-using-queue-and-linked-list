Hospital Management System using Linked List & Queue

📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a C-based project designed to efficiently manage patient records and organize hospital appointments using Linked List and Queue data structures. This project eliminates manual errors, reduces waiting times, and ensures smooth patient handling by implementing a structured approach.

🎯 Features

✅ Patient Record Management (Linked List)

Add new patient details (Name, Age, Disease, Contact Info, etc.).

Search for a patient using their name or ID.

Update patient details if required.

Delete patient records once treatment is completed.


✅ Appointment Management (Queue)

Patients book appointments in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.

Ensures fair and organized check-ins.

Allows hospitals to manage appointment flow efficiently.


🔍 Problem Statement

Hospitals often struggle with manual record-keeping and unstructured appointment systems, leading to:

Long waiting times for patients.

Inefficient search and retrieval of patient information.

Difficulty in handling appointments, especially during emergencies.


💡 Solution Approach

Linked List: Efficient dynamic storage for patient records.

Queue: Ensures fair patient appointment order.

Simple and effective operations for hospitals with limited resources.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Data Structures Used:

Singly Linked List for patient records.

Queue for appointment management.



⚡ How It Works

1️⃣ Adding a Patient: New patient details are stored in a linked list.
2️⃣ Searching a Patient: The system traverses the list to find the requested patient.
3️⃣ Updating a Patient Record: The existing record is modified based on user input.
4️⃣ Deleting a Patient Record: The linked list is adjusted after removing the patient.
5️⃣ Booking an Appointment: Patients are queued up in FIFO order.
6️⃣ Serving an Appointment: The first patient in the queue is served and removed.


📌 Future Enhancements

Add file storage to save records permanently.

Implement a priority queue for emergency patients.

Develop a GUI-based version for better user experience.
